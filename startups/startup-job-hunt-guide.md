### **Step 2 — Resume vs Job Description Analysis**

Before applying, ensure your resume *matches* the job description.  
Use the following **ChatGPT prompt** to analyze alignment and identify missing keywords or skills.

#### 🧠 Prompt

```
You are a career optimization assistant. Analyze my resume and the attached job description. Calculate how well my resume aligns with the job description.

Evaluation Criteria:
If match is 75% or higher: Tell me to apply!
If match is below 75%: Don’t apply yet. Instead, provide a clear plan:
- Tell me exactly which skills are missing or weak on my resume.
- Give step-by-step instructions on how to fix it.
- Should I add new bullet points? If yes, provide examples using keywords from the JD.
- Should I rewrite existing bullet points? If yes, tell me which ones and give improved versions.

This prompt should help me improve my resume in a targeted way before applying.
```

📎 *Make sure you upload both your Resume and Job Description before running the prompt.*

### **Step 3 — Find Founders and Employees on LinkedIn**

Search for:
- Founders, hiring managers, or team leads at your target startup  
- People with similar roles (Data Analyst, Software Engineer, etc.)  

✅ Connect with them  
✅ Engage with their posts  
✅ Mention mutual interests or company news in your message

---

### **Step 4 — Get Company Email IDs**

Use Chrome extensions like:
- **RocketReach**  
- **Snov.io**  
- **Apollo.io**

These tools help you find professional emails for company employees and hiring teams.

---

### **Step 5 — Write a Cold Email**

Once you have contacts, send a **personalized cold email** (under 200 words).  
Keep it **polite, confident, and specific** — not generic.

#### 💬 Prompt

```
