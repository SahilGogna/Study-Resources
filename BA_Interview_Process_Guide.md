## 3) Case Study / Business Scenario Round

### 🎯 Purpose
Test your **structured thinking** on ambiguous, real‑world problems.

### Example Case Study
**Scenario:**  
A retail bank finds that its **loan application process takes 10 days**, causing customer drop‑offs. They want to reduce this to under 5 days without compromising risk checks.

**Task:**  
- Identify the main problem areas.  
- Suggest a high‑level solution.  
- Outline data points you’d analyze.  
- Propose metrics to track success.  

**Solution Approach:**  
1. **Understand Current Process (As‑Is):** Break down steps: Application → Document Verification → Credit Check → Approval → Disbursement.  
2. **Identify Bottlenecks:** Delays in manual document verification and third‑party credit checks.  
3. **Propose Improvements:**  
   - Automate document verification using OCR.  
   - Integrate directly with credit bureau APIs.  
   - Parallelize verification & credit check steps.  
4. **Data Needed:** Average processing time per step, % of drop‑offs, error/rework rates.  
5. **Metrics:** Avg processing time, NPS (satisfaction), % approvals within SLA.  

### 💬 Other Case Prompts
1. E‑commerce company sees drop in repeat customers. How do you investigate?  
2. Insurance firm wants to reduce claim processing time. What steps do you take?  
3. Telecom provider facing high churn. How do you analyze?  
4. Bank wants to launch a new mobile app feature. What’s your approach?  
5. Retailer wants to optimize inventory. How do you proceed?  

### ✅ Do’s
- Structure answer in **steps** (Current → Problem → Options → Recommendation → Metrics).  
- Clarify assumptions early.  
- Tie solution to **business value** (time saved, revenue gained).  

### ❌ Don’ts
- Jump into random solutions without framing the problem.  
- Ignore feasibility/cost.  
- Forget to suggest measurable KPIs.

1. Tell me about a time you managed conflicting stakeholder requirements.  
2. How do you handle incomplete requirements?
