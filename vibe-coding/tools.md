# Vibe Coding: Complete Platform Guide 2026

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is building apps by describing what you want in plain text—AI generates the code. You focus on **what** to build, AI handles **how** to code it. You test by running the app, not reading every line of code.

**Why it matters:** Build portfolio projects in days instead of months, create MVPs without hiring developers, prototype dashboards without frontend expertise.

- Quality drops for complex/large projects
- Still need product sense and design taste
- Best for prototypes and MVPs, not production systems at scale
- Plan to involve professional developers for production-ready apps

**Bottom line:** Vibe coding is a multiplier on your skills, not a replacement for them. Use it to build faster, validate ideas quicker, and learn by doing.
