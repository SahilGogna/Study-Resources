---

### **Projects**
**Why Projects Matter**  
Projects demonstrate your practical application of skills, especially if you lack professional experience.  
They should highlight **relevance to the role** and **impact** ‚Äî avoid listing tools without context.

**Best Practices:**
- 2‚Äì3 strong projects are better than 5 generic ones  
- Follow **CAR** (Challenge ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Result) or **STAR** (Situation ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Result)  
- Always mention tools & quantify results

**Example (CAR Method):**
**Sales Data Analysis**  
- **Challenge:** Seasonal customer churn was impacting revenue.  
- **Action:** Used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze over 1M sales transactions, identifying churn patterns.  
- **Result:** Recommended retention strategies projected to reduce revenue loss by 20%.

### **Experience**
**Why Experience is Key**  
Your work experience section should be **impact-focused** and **relevant** to the role you‚Äôre applying for.  
Avoid listing every task ‚Äî instead, highlight achievements that align with the job description.

**Best Practices:**
- Use **4‚Äì5 bullet points per role** (up to 6 for your most recent role)  
- Place **most recent experience first**  
- Apply **CAR / STAR** methodology to make impact clear  
- If past roles are irrelevant, focus on **transferable skills** and **projects** instead

**Example (STAR Method):**
**Data Analyst Intern**  
ABC Inc., Toronto, ON  
May 2023 ‚Äì Aug 2023  
- **Situation:** Monthly performance reporting was slow and prone to errors  
- **Task:** Improve reporting efficiency for the analytics team  
- **Action:** Automated weekly Excel reports and built Tableau dashboards for real-time tracking  
- **Result:** Reduced reporting time by **40%** and improved data accuracy for decision-making

---

**Why use CAR / STAR?**
- Forces you to focus on **impact**, not just tasks.  
- Makes bullet points more **specific and memorable**.  
- Highlights both your **problem-solving process** and the **outcome**.  

**Formula to remember:**  
> **[Action Verb] + [What you did] + [Tools used] + [Quantifiable result]**

### **Certifications**
Only mention **proctored** certifications:
- Google Data Analytics Certificate *(Coursera, Proctored)*  
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
