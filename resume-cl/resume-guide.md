---

### **Profile Summary**
Your summary is the first thing recruiters read — you have **5–7 seconds** to grab attention.

**Why it matters:**  
- Highlights skills, experience, and business impact  
- Differentiates you from other applicants  
- Makes your resume feel tailored

**Steps to write a strong summary:**
1. Start with a powerful opening statement
2. Highlight core technical skills
3. Emphasize measurable business impact
4. Tailor it to the role or industry

**Pro tips:**
- Keep it 50–100 words
- Use bullet points or clear formatting
- Avoid generic claims — show proof of value

**Examples:**

*No Experience:*  
- Aspiring Data Analyst with strong foundations in SQL, Python, and Tableau through academic projects and certifications.  
- Passionate about leveraging data for business decisions — built a predictive model improving forecast accuracy by 15%.  
- Skilled in Excel for data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboards, reducing reporting time by 25%.

*Experienced:*  
- Expertise in Data Analysis & Business Insights: 3+ years experience improving operational efficiency by 15%.  
- Proficient in Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, creating dashboards that reduced reporting time by 30%.  
- Strong SQL & Python skills, improving forecast accuracy by 20%.

---

### **Education**
**Format:**  
Degree \| University – City, Province  
Month YYYY – Month YYYY  
GPA (if >3.0), Dean’s List (if applicable), Relevant Awards

**Avoid:**  
- Listing high school once you have post-secondary  
- Including course lists unless highly relevant

---

### **Skills**
**Only include hard skills.** Group them by type:
- **Programming:** Python, SQL, R  
- **Tools:** Power BI, Excel, Tableau  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL  

---

### **Projects**
**Why Projects Matter**  
Projects demonstrate your practical application of skills, especially if you lack professional experience.  
They should highlight **relevance to the role** and **impact** — avoid listing tools without context.

**Best Practices:**
- 2–3 strong projects are better than 5 generic ones  
- Follow **CAR** (Challenge → Action → Result) or **STAR** (Situation → Task → Action → Result)  
- Always mention tools & quantify results

**Example (CAR Method):**
**Sales Data Analysis**  
- **Challenge:** Seasonal customer churn was impacting revenue.  
- **Action:** Used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze over 1M sales transactions, identifying churn patterns.  
- **Result:** Recommended retention strategies projected to reduce revenue loss by 20%.  

**Another Example:**
**LinkedIn Job Posting Scraper**  
- Built a web scraping pipeline that processed **10,000+ listings** to analyze hiring trends  
- Created an interactive dashboard used by **20+ classmates**, helping **5+ secure roles** based on insights

---

### **Experience**
**Why Experience is Key**  
Your work experience section should be **impact-focused** and **relevant** to the role you’re applying for.  
Avoid listing every task — instead, highlight achievements that align with the job description.

**Best Practices:**
- Use **4–5 bullet points per role** (up to 6 for your most recent role)  
- Place **most recent experience first**  
- Apply **CAR / STAR** methodology to make impact clear  
- If past roles are irrelevant, focus on **transferable skills** and **projects** instead

**Example (STAR Method):**
**Data Analyst Intern**  
ABC Inc., Toronto, ON  
May 2023 – Aug 2023  
- **Situation:** Monthly performance reporting was slow and prone to errors  
- **Task:** Improve reporting efficiency for the analytics team  
- **Action:** Automated weekly Excel reports and built Tableau dashboards for real-time tracking  
- **Result:** Reduced reporting time by **40%** and improved data accuracy for decision-making

---

**Why use CAR / STAR?**
- Forces you to focus on **impact**, not just tasks.  
- Makes bullet points more **specific and memorable**.  
- Highlights both your **problem-solving process** and the **outcome**.  

**Formula to remember:**  
> **[Action Verb] + [What you did] + [Tools used] + [Quantifiable result]**

---

### **Certifications**
Only mention **proctored** certifications:
- Google Data Analytics Certificate *(Coursera, Proctored)*  
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner  
- Microsoft Excel Expert (MO-201)  

---

### **Optional Sections**
**Volunteering / Extracurriculars** — highlight leadership or initiative.  

**Example:**
Volunteer Coordinator, TEDxXYZU  
Organized and managed 20+ volunteers during live speaker events, improving event flow and attendee experience.

---

## 3️⃣ Tailoring Your Resume
- Extract **keywords** from the job posting (skills, tools, responsibilities).
- Mirror those keywords in **summary, skills, projects, and experience**.
- Prioritize **most relevant** experiences at the top of each section.

## 48-Point ATS Resume Checklist

*Your Complete Guide to Beating Applicant Tracking Systems*

### File Format & Setup

- **1. Save as .docx first, then export to PDF**  
  *Why: ATS reads Word files best. Create in Word, then save as PDF for final submission.*

- **2. Keep file size under 1MB**  
  *Why: Large files may fail to upload or process properly.*

- **3. Name file professionally: "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf"**  
  *Why: Helps recruiters find your resume easily when downloaded.*

- **4. Use only one column layout**  
  *Why: Multiple columns break ATS parsing—it reads left to right, top to bottom.*

---

### Fonts & Formatting

- **5. Use standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, or Georgia**  
  *Why: Fancy fonts can't be read by ATS and show up as symbols.*

- **6. Font size between 10-12pt for body text**  
  *Why: Too small = hard to read. Too large = looks unprofessional.*

- **7. Use 14-16pt for your name only**  
  *Why: Makes your name stand out without confusing the ATS.*

- **8. Avoid italics, underlining, and excessive bold**  
  *Why: ATS may misread styled text or skip it entirely.*

- **9. Use standard bullet points (• or -)**  
  *Why: Special characters like ✓ ★ ➤ confuse ATS parsing.*

- **10. No headers or footers**  
  *Why: ATS skips header/footer content—your contact info will disappear.*

- **11. No text boxes**  
  *Why: ATS can't read text inside boxes and will skip that content.*

- **12. No tables**  
  *Why: Tables break ATS parsing—information gets jumbled or lost.*

- **13. No images, logos, or photos**  
  *Why: ATS is text-only and skips all visual elements completely.*

- **14. No graphics, charts, or infographics**  
  *Why: Same as images—ATS cannot process visual information.*

---

### Contact Information

- **15. Put contact info at the top of page (not in header)**  
  *Why: ATS skips headers, so your contact details must be in the main document.*

- **16. Include: Full name, phone, email, LinkedIn, location**  
  *Why: ATS looks for these specific fields to categorize your application.*

- **17. Use a professional email address**  
  *Why: Emails like "partyguy123@gmail.com" get filtered out by ATS and recruiters.*

- **18. LinkedIn URL should be custom (linkedin.com/in/yourname)**  
  *Why: Clean URLs are ATS-friendly and look more professional.*

- **19. Don't include full address (just "Toronto, ON")**  
  *Why: Privacy + saves space. City and province are sufficient for ATS.*

---

### Section Headings

- **20. Use standard section titles: "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills"**  
  *Why: ATS looks for these exact terms to categorize your information.*

- **21. Avoid creative headings like "Where I've Been"**  
  *Why: ATS won't recognize these and may miss entire sections.*

- **22. Use "Work Experience" not "Experience" alone**  
  *Why: "Work Experience" is the standard term ATS systems search for.*

- **23. Include: Contact, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills**  
  *Why: These are the core sections every ATS expects to find.*

- **24. List sections in standard order**  
  *Why: Contact → Summary → Experience → Education → Skills*

---

### Work Experience

- **25. List jobs in reverse chronological order**  
  *Why: ATS and recruiters expect to see your current/recent role first.*

- **26. Include: Job title, Company, Location, Dates**  
  *Why: ATS extracts these fields to build your profile—missing any creates gaps.*

- **27. Spell out months: "January 2023" not "Jan 2023"**  
  *Why: Different ATS systems parse dates differently—spelled out is safest.*

- **28. Use "Present" for current roles**  
  *Why: "Present" is the standard term ATS recognizes for ongoing employment.*

- **29. Start bullets with action verbs**  
  *Why: Action verbs are keywords ATS scans for and show impact.*

- **30. Include numbers and metrics**  
  *Why: Metrics are often keywords and prove your impact quantifiably.*

- **31. Mirror keywords from job description**  
  *Why: ATS ranks resumes by keyword match percentage—use their language.*

- **32. Spell out acronyms: "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)"**  
  *Why: ATS might search for either the full term or acronym—include both.*

- **33. Don't use "I," "me," "my"**  
  *Why: "Led team" not "I led team"—it's cleaner and more professional.*

- **34. Keep bullets to 1-2 lines maximum**  
  *Why: Concise bullets are easier for both ATS and humans to scan.*

---

### Education

- **35. List degree, school name, location, graduation date**  
  *Why: ATS extracts these specific fields for education verification.*

- **36. Spell out your degree fully**  
  *Why: "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science" not "BS CS"—ATS searches for full names.*

- **37. Include GPA only if above 3.5**  
  *Why: Low GPA hurts you, high GPA helps—leave it out if mediocre.*

- **38. Include certifications**  
  *Why: Certifications are powerful keywords that boost your ATS score.*

---

### Skills Section

- **39. Create a "Skills" or "Technical Skills" section**  
  *Why: ATS specifically scans this section for required technical keywords.*

- **40. List skills exactly as in job posting**  
  *Why: If they say "JavaScript" don't write "JS"—exact match = higher score.*

- **41. Separate skills with commas, not slashes**  
  *Why: "Python/SQL/AWS" may be read as one skill—use "Python, SQL, AWS" instead.*

- **42. Include hard and soft skills**  
  *Why: Most ATS systems scan for both technical abilities and soft skills.*

- **43. Don't rate skills with bars or percentages**  
  *Why: ATS can't read visual skill ratings—just list the skills as text.*

---

### Final Checks

- **44. Remove special characters: @, #, &, %, $**  
  *Why: These can break ATS parsing and cause errors in text extraction.*

- **45. Run a spell check**  
  *Why: Typos reduce your keyword match and look unprofessional.*

- **46. Use keywords 5-7 times throughout**  
  *Why: Keyword frequency matters—but don't stuff unnaturally or you'll get flagged.*

- **47. Keep to 1 page (<5 years) or 2 pages max**  
  *Why: ATS has no preference, but recruiters do—respect their time.*

- **48. Test through a free ATS scanner**  
  *Why: Tools like Jobscan show exactly how ATS will read your resume.*

---

### Bonus Tip

> After optimizing for ATS, always have a **human-friendly version** ready. Once you pass ATS, a real person reads it—make sure it's compelling for them too!

---

## 🏁 Final Note
Your resume won’t get you the job — it will get you the **interview**.  
Keep it **clear, relevant, and specific**. Show **value**, not just tasks.
